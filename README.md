# Image-Manipulation
"I developed a C++ program that processes colored PPM images in either ASCII or binary format. The program employs a structured approach, reading image data into a defined 'image' structure using the 'readImage' function and dynamically allocating memory for red, green, and blue pixels, later saving it with 'writeImage.' All file operations are carried out in binary mode, and the program offers options for image manipulation, including flipping on the X and Y axes, clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation, grayscale conversion, and sepia tone application, all based on user input. The project is organized into multiple files, handling memory allocation, image manipulation, file I/O, and function prototypes. Overall, this program effectively transforms colored PPM images into various formats and provides flexibility for users to choose between binary and ASCII output."
